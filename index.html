                instructions: "Start by cooking the spaghetti according to package instructions. In a bowl, whisk together eggs and grated parmesan cheese. Once the spaghetti is cooked, drain and reserve some pasta water. In a hot pan, cook pancetta until crispy. Add the hot pasta and egg-cheese mixture, stirring quickly to create a creamy sauce. Season with freshly cracked black pepper to taste, and serve immediately.",

Combining crispy pancetta, a velvety egg and cheese sauce, and perfectly al dente pasta, it creates a simple yet indulgent meal. This dish is perfect for any occasion, whether it's a quick weeknight dinner or a special meal with friends and family.",
                tips: "For a richer taste, try adding a bit of garlic when cooking the pancetta. You can also use Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan for a more authentic flavor."

Add crunchy croutons and sprinkle with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Optionally, top with anchovies for extra umami. Season with black pepper to taste, and garnish with a wedge of lemon.",
                description: "The Caesar Salad is a timeless classic that's both refreshing and satisfying. With its crunchy lettuce, creamy dressing, and sharp Parmesan, it’s the perfect side dish to accompany any main course or can be enjoyed on its own.
